### Todo

- [x] Make a GUI
- [x] Make a cost graph
- [x] ~Multithreading~ The rayon crate is slow in this project for some reason
- [x] Make the GUI in a different thread so it doesn't limit epoch count per second
- [ ] Saving and loading states
- [ ] Image interpolation
- [ ] Multi-image interpolation
